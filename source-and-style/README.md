**Assignment 1: Inspecting the Cultural Web**

**Website**
Internet Archive
https://archive.org

**Overview**

The Internet Archive is a nonprofit digital library. It provides free access to books, music, movies, and other digital materials. Users can search and access items that are in the public domain or shared openly by creators.

**Web Technologies Used**

After using the browser’s Inspect tool, I found that the website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML is used to build the structure of the website. I saw common tags such as html, head, body, div, and script in the Elements tab.

CSS is used to design the website. I noticed several files ending in .css. These control the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.

JavaScript is used for interactive features. I saw many files ending in .js. JavaScript is used for playing audio and video, search functions, buttons, and loading content without refreshing the page. Some files ended in .min.js, which means they are compressed for faster performance.

**Who Built the Website**

The Internet Archive was founded by Brewster Kahle and is maintained by the Internet Archive organization. I did not find a public GitHub repository for the main website. This suggests that it is developed and maintained internally by a team of developers.

**Conclusion**

The Internet Archive uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive features. It is a professionally built website maintained by a nonprofit organization.
